 Within Zeta Tau Alpha, love is essentially the greatest of all things. To share their love for the Athens community, the Gamma Pi Chapter, located at the University of Georgia,
 puts great emphasis on their philanthropy, breast cancer awareness. Each year in April, the sorority chapter hosts a community-wide fundraising event called "Diamond Challenge." 
 Teams made up of ten to twelve men compete against eachother in games of softball, all while raising money for this wonderful cause. Through extended commitment, this past year, the University
 of Georgia Zeta Tau Alpha Chapter raised over $100,000. This page is to highlight and recap their great accomplishes.
 All of us have been affected by cancer in one way or another, but together, we can make a difference!
